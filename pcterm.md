## Technical Notes

The application is well-structured with clearly defined sections for different functionalities. It makes extensive use of BASIC's GOTO and GOSUB statements for flow control, which was common for BASIC programs of this era. The program also interacts directly with memory locations and uses machine language subroutines for certain functions, indicating it's designed specifically for the Commodore 128 hardware platform.
